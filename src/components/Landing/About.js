        <h1>What I do</h1>
        <p>
          I am a software developer specialising in Web development. I build
          fullstack web applications written with a <strong>React</strong>{" "}
          frontend and a variety of backends depending on the need of the
          client. These include:
          <strong> Django</strong>, <strong>Flask</strong>,
          <strong> Laravel</strong>, <strong>Javalin</strong> and
          <strong> Node</strong>. With the option of hosting on{" "}
          <strong>AWS</strong> or if possible, static web servers. My recent
          focus has been on creating <strong>JAM</strong> stack web applications
          due to the flexability and speed the offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          My development focus is on web accessibility. If you are creating your
          sites to work on Internet Explorer{" "}
          <i>
            (which is around <strong>3%</strong> of web users in Australia)
          </i>{" "}
          but are not making your website accessible{" "}
          <i>
            (around <strong>20%</strong> of Australians have difficulty using a
            website that has not been made accessible)
          </i>
          you are missing out on a market.{" "}

            <i>
              Why wouldnâ€™t you want everyone to be able to enjoy the content you
              have created?

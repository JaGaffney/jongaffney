        <p>
          I am a software developer specialising in Web development. I build
          fullstack web applications written with the
          <strong> JavaScript</strong> framework (
          <i>or library depending on who you ask</i>) <strong>React</strong>. I
          am flexible with backend development and have experience using
          multiple frameworks across various languages depending on the needs of
          the client. These include:
          <strong> Django</strong>, <strong>Flask</strong> and
          <strong> Node</strong>, with the option of hosting on{" "}
          <strong>AWS</strong>. My recent focus has been creating{" "}
          <strong>JAM stack</strong> web applications due to the flexibility and
          speed they provide.
